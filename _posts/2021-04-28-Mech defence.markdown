[Mech defence](https://frainx8.itch.io/mech-defence) is my first 3D game made for [MechJam](https://itch.io/jam/mechjam). I had a big plan for this game but my perfectionism didn't allow me to make it true. In result the game wasn't also polished by deadline, so I learned why setting borders for projects is crutial.
